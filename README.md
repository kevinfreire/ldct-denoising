# ldct-denoising
This project consists of image de-noising on Low-Dose CT images using Generative adversarial networks.
All data was obtained through the Cancer Imaging Archive website at https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=52758026

You first want to create a virtual Environment and install all the requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt
Afterwards you want to run the prep.py file to prepare all your data.  You have the option to normalize your training/testing data within the prep.py.

This repository is still under development and not completed, I have two branches for different model training however my most current branch is rinet.
