All data was obtained through the Cancer Imaging Archive website at https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=52758026

You first want to create a virtual Environment and install all the requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt
Afterwards you want to run the prep.py file to prepare all your data.
