% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}
Computerize Tomography (CT) has enabled direct imaging on the 3-dimensional structure of different organs and tissues inside the human body in a non-invasive manner. CT scans are constructed by combining the X-ray scans taken on several angles and orientations.  It has several utilities but very useful in detecting lesions, tensions, tumours, and metastasis.  It can reveal their presence and the spatial location, size and extent of the tumour.  CT imaging has become a frequent tool for cancer diagnosis, angiography, and detecting internal injuries.  However, despite the evidence of its utility for diagnosis and patient management, the potential risk of radiation-induced malignancy exists \cite{brenner2007computed}.  Studies found that CT alone contributes to almost half of the total radiation exposure from medical use alone.  Recent studies reveal that as much as 1.2 - 2\% of cancers may eventually be caused by the radiation dose conceived by the patient while undergoing CT scans \cite{schauer2009national}.  To reduce the risk, the principles of ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) is now a profound practice predicted in CT imaging \cite{protection2007icrp}.  In regards to this practice, Low Dose CT (LDCT) is a promising solution in reducing radiation exposure \cite{trattner2014standardization}.  In low dose CT, radiation exposure is decreased by lowering the tube current, or voltage.  However, by reducing the tube voltage or current it introduces several artefacts and lowers the diagnostic quality of the LDCT image \cite{boas2012ct}.  In order to boost the quality of an LDCT image, the reconstruction of LDCT has become a primary research.  There are various methods that can be classified under three categories: (a) iterative reconstruction, (b) sinogram filtration based techniques, and (c) image post-processing based technique.  In recent times, researchers were trying to develop new iterative algorithms (IR) for LDCT image reconstruction.  Iterative reconstruction algorithms considerably suppresses the image noise, but still lose some details and suffer from remaining artefacts.  Other disadvantages with IR techniques is the high computational cost, which is a bottle neck in practical utilization.  Sinogram filtration on the other hand, directly works on the projection data before reconstructing the image and is more computationally economical than the IR technique.  However, the data of commercial scanners are not readily available to users, and this method suffers from edge blurring and the resolution loss.  Many efforts were made in the image domain to reduce LDCT noise and suppress artefacts.\\
With the explosive evolution of deep neural networks, the LDCT denoising task is now dominated by deep neural networks.  However, the research on deep learning-based LDCT denoising is confined to designing a network architecture based on the vanilla convolution operation.  There has been a surge in interest in desinging General Adversarial Networks (GAN), mainly for image generation and becoming popular in denoising medical images as shown in \cite{8340157}, \cite{9474492}, \cite{yin2021unpaired}.  In this paper we explore the possibility of applying GAN to the task of LDCT desnoising.\\
	In many image-related reconstruction tasks, it is known that minimizing the per-pixel loss between the output image and the ground truth alone generate either blurring or makes the result visually unappealing \cite{huang2017beyond}.  The same effect was observed in the traditional neural network-based CT denoising works \cite{chen2017low}, \cite{chen2017low2}.  The adversarial loss introduced by GAN can be treated as a driving force to push the generated image to look as close to as the groung truth image or in this case the Normal Dose CT image (NDCT) which also reduces the blurring effect. Further more, an additional perceptual loss was also introduced to measure the feature of the denoised image, with a focus on areas that the human eye cannot see. \\
Generative Adversarial Network was first introduced in 2014 by Goodfellow \emph{et al}. \cite{goodfellow2014generative}.  It is a genrative model trying to generate real world images by employing a min-max optimization framework where two networks (Generator G and Discriminator D) are trained against each other.  G tries to synthesize real appearing images from random noise wheras D is trying to distiguish between the generated and real images.  If the Generator G get sufficiently well trained, the Discriminator D will eventually be unable to tell if the generated image is fake or not.\\
	The original setup of GAN does not contain any constraints to control what modes of data it can generate.  However, the auxiliary information were provided during the generation, GAN can be driven to output images with specific modes.  In this scenario, GAN is usually referred to as conditional GAN (cGAN) since the output is conditioned on additional information.  Bera \emph{et al}. \cite{9474492} proposed a discriminator function for CT denoising task, which leverages self-attention and pixel-wise GANs for restoring the diagnostic quality of LDCT images.  Yi \emph{et al}. \cite{yi2018sharpness}. propsed an adversarial trained network and a sharpness detection network to denoise LDCT images. Both \cite{8340157} and \cite{yin2021unpaired} used Wasserstein GAN with Perceptual Loss and Wasserstein Distance to generate a denoised image of an LDCT image. \\
	In this paper, we make the following contributions:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We built a GAN architecture similar to Alsaiari \emph{et al}. \cite{alsaiari2019image}. with the exception of trianing it pecifically on LDCT images.
		\item Computed similar loss functions as \cite{alsaiari2019image} with the exception of using the Mean Squared Error Loss function instead of computing L2-norm.
		\item Present the output results of the network after training.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  The proposed method based on \cite{alsaiari2019image}, with perceptual loss, pixel-pixel loss, smooth loss and adversarial loss are presented in \ref{method} and \ref{loss function}.  Then, experiments and analysis of the results are presented in section \ref{experiment settings} and \ref{results and discussion}.  Lastly, Section \ref{conclusion} gives a summary of this paper and looks forward to some possible future research directions.
